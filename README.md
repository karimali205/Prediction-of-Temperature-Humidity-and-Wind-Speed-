 # Climate Prediction "Temperature-Humidity-and-Wind-Speed" and Agricultural Impact Model

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model utilizing deep learning technology, specifically the **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** network within the **Time Series** framework, to forecast various climatic elements such as **temperature**, **humidity**, and **wind speed**. This model is designed to leverage extensive meteorological data and diverse climatic factors, enabling it to generate accurate predictions of these elements. 

Subsequently, the model's output will be utilized to assess the **impact of climate variations** on the productivity of **rice** and **wheat crops** within a specific region, focusing on **Fayoum Governorate**.

## Data and Training Process
The training process for this model incorporated **historical climatic data** sourced from the **NASA Power website**, spanning a decade. This dataset provided **hourly readings** of the targeted climatic elements, which were critical for the model's training phase.

- The **LSTM network** underwent **500 epochs** of training.
- Achieved a prediction accuracy of **95%**.
- The training data comprised an extensive range of climatic observations, enabling the model to learn and adapt to various climatic patterns effectively.

## Model Predictions and Visualization
Upon completion of the training phase, the model's predictions were visualized through **graphical representations**, illustrating:
- The relationships between each climatic element and time.
- The relationships between the elements themselves and their respective ranges.

These visualizations highlighted the model's evolving accuracy across different epochs, showcasing its capability to adapt and refine its predictions over time.

## Significance and Applications
This project's significance lies in its potential applications in **agricultural planning** and **management**. By providing accurate forecasts of critical climatic elements, the model offers valuable insights into how climate variability can influence **crop yields**, specifically for **rice** and **wheat** in **Fayoum Governorate**.

These insights can aid local farmers and agricultural stakeholders in making informed decisions, ultimately enhancing crop productivity and resilience against climatic fluctuations.

## Conclusion
In summary, this project presents a sophisticated approach to **climate prediction** using **deep learning**, with practical implications for agricultural productivity in regions susceptible to climate change. Through the integration of **advanced predictive modeling** and **comprehensive historical data analysis**, the project demonstrates a robust methodology for understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate variability on essential crop yields.
